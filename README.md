## Project Title

Project implements Multi Modal Image Registration using Demons Algorithm 

## Getting Started

This project tries to apply Multi Modal Image Registration on visible and thermal images using Demons algorithm
The algorithm uses edge map as the common feature between visible and thermal images for non-rigid demons algorithm.

## Framework used

Matlab

## Implementation

The inputs images are visible and thermal images take from similar viewing points.

I use two step approach 1) coarse registration and 2) Fine Registration. 
Initial coarse registration enables alignment of images based on reference objects or generic affine registration algorithms.
Fine registration uses edge maps generated from the coarse registration to improve registration accuracy. Demons algorithms enables higher degree of freedom, making the registration free from constrainst of affine registration.


## Input Images a) Visible and 2) Thermal Image

## Coarse Registration (Affine Registration) 

## Fine Registration (Demons Algorithm)
